## Game Background

Players play as an adventurous wizard apprentice who must fend off monster attacks and search for treasures.
By picking up items dropped by monsters, players can upgrade their weapons and learn new spells. 
Players can use the spells they have learned to attack monsters, and can also combine different elements to create different spell effects. 
Additionally, players must switch to appropriate spells to deal with different types of monsters they encounter.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the following steps:
- Install the Unity engine
- download this folder
- Run the New Unity Project (1).exe to start playing

## Controls

The default control scheme uses the keyboard and mouse. 
Players use the mouse to move, aim, and fire, and the keyboard to use skills, similar to the control scheme in League of Legends.
- 'Q' 'W' 'E' 'R' for using skills
- Left mouse button to move character
- Right mouse button to pick up dropped items and interact with objects in the environment
- 'I' to open inventory and use potions, magic elements
- 'Space' to exit from the workbench

## Gameplay

Players can adventure in the map and use magic skills to inflict damage on monsters. 
By picking up magic gems dropped by defeated monsters, players can convert them into magic potions in their inventory, and then use the workbench to craft unique skills.
The magic potions are divided into black, red, yellow, blue, and green, and all except for green have attack power corresponding to their attributes. 
After crafting skills, players can use them directly in battle, while green potions can be used to restore health directly from the inventory.
